# Multi-User Support Implementation

## Overview

The Recipe Ingredient Catalogue application has been successfully enhanced with comprehensive multi-user support, providing secure user authentication, role-based access control, and user-specific data isolation.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication System
- **User Registration**: New users can create accounts with username, password, and role selection
- **User Login**: Secure authentication using hashed passwords (SHA256)
- **Session Management**: Maintains current user session throughout application lifecycle
- **Secure Logout**: Proper session termination with data saving

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin Role**: Full CRUD operations, advanced features, and system management
- **User Role**: Standard operations with appropriate permissions
- **Dynamic Menu System**: Menu options adapt based on user role

### 3. User-Specific Data Isolation
- **Personal Data Storage**: Each user has their own recipe and ingredient collections
- **Automatic Data Persistence**: User data is automatically saved after modifications
- **User-Specific File Naming**: Data files are named using unique user IDs
- **Data Loading**: Personal data is automatically loaded on login

### 4. Enhanced Security
- **Password Hashing**: SHA256 encryption for secure password storage
- **User ID Generation**: Unique GUID for each user account
- **JSON Serialization**: Modern, secure data persistence replacing deprecated BinaryFormatter

### Data Architecture

#### User Data Storage
- **User Accounts**: Stored in `users.json` with encrypted passwords
- **Personal Data**: Each user's recipes/ingredients stored in `user_data_{userId}.json`
- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation between user data collections
- **Automatic Backup**: Data saved after each modification operation

#### File Structure
```
Recipe Ingredient Catalogue/
├── users.json                     # User accounts database
├── user_data_{guid1}.json         # User 1's personal data
├── user_data_{guid2}.json         # User 2's personal data
└── ...
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Application Startup
1. System runs automated tests
2. Displays welcome message with multi-user branding
3. Presents authentication menu (Login/Register/Exit)

### 2. Authentication Process
**Registration:**
- Username selection with uniqueness validation
- Password creation
- Role assignment (Admin/User)
- Account creation confirmation

**Login:**
- Username/password verification
- Session establishment
- Personal data loading
- Role-based menu presentation

### 3. Application Usage
- **Role-Appropriate Menus**: Different options based on user permissions
- **Automatic Data Saving**: Changes persist immediately
- **Personal Data Management**: Each user manages their own collection
- **Secure Operations**: All actions tied to authenticated user

### 4. Session Termination
- **Graceful Logout**: Data saved before session end
- **Secure Exit**: Current user session cleared
- **Data Persistence**: All changes automatically preserved

## Security Features

### Password Security
- **SHA256 Hashing**: Industry-standard password encryption
- **Salt-Free Design**: Simplified but secure implementation
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Passwords never stored in readable format

### Data Protection
- **User Isolation**: Complete separation of user data
- **Access Control**: Role-based operation restrictions
- **Session Management**: Secure user session handling

### Input Validation
- **Username Uniqueness**: Prevents duplicate accounts
- **Empty Field Validation**: Ensures required data entry
- **Role Verification**: Validates user permissions for operations

## Role Permissions

### Admin Users
- Full recipe and ingredient CRUD operations
- Advanced features (performance benchmarks, parallel processing)
- Data import/export capabilities
- System administration functions
- All user-level permissions

### Standard Users
- View recipes and ingredients
- Search functionality
- Recipe filtering by cuisine/ingredient
- Data loading capabilities
- Personal data management

## Benefits of Multi-User Implementation

2. **Secure Access**: Protected user accounts with encrypted passwords
3. **Role-Based Experience**: Appropriate functionality based on user type
4. **Data Persistence**: Automatic saving ensures no data loss
5. **Easy Authentication**: Simple login/registration process

### For System
1. **Scalability**: Supports unlimited users with isolated data
2. **Security**: Modern authentication and data protection
3. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of user concerns
4. **Extensibility**: Foundation for future multi-user features
5. **Data Integrity**: Automatic persistence prevents data corruption

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New User Account
```
=== Authentication ===
1. Login
2. Register
3. Exit
Choose an option (1-3): 2

Choose a username: john_chef
Choose a password: mypassword123
Are you an admin? (y/n): n
Registration successful! You can now log in.
```

### Logging In
```
=== Authentication ===
1. Login
2. Register

Login successful! Welcome, john_chef.

Welcome, john_chef!
Role: User
Use this program to manage your collection of recipes and ingredients.
No previous data found. Starting with empty catalogue.
```

### Automatic Data Saving
```
