## Questions You Might Be Asked

### Q: "How does the authentication system work?"
**A:** "I use BCrypt hashing for password security - industry standard. Each user gets their own data file with complete isolation. The system supports role-based access with admins getting additional features."

### Q: "What design patterns did you implement?"
**A:** "Circuit Breaker for fault tolerance, Factory for object creation, Strategy for different algorithms, and Observer for logging. Each serves a specific architectural purpose."

### Q: "How does the inheritance hierarchy work?"
**A:** "Four levels: Ingredient (base) → PerishableIngredient (adds expiration) → RefrigeratedIngredient (adds temperature) → FrozenIngredient (adds freeze-thaw cycles). Each level adds specialized behavior."

### Q: "What makes this beyond typical coursework?"
**A:** "The multi-user authentication, enterprise design patterns, advanced data structures like Trie and LRU cache, parallel processing, and production-ready architecture. Most assignments are single-user with basic features."
