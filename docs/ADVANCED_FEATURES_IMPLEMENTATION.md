var sum = Avx2.Add(a, b);
sum.StoreUnsafe(ref result[i]);
```

3. **Half-Open**: Testing state to check if service has recovered

#### Technical Implementation:
```csharp
public T Execute<T>(Func<T> operation)
{
    // State checking and transition logic
    if (_state == CircuitState.Open && ShouldAttemptReset())
    {
        _state = CircuitState.HalfOpen;
    }
    
    try
    {
        var result = operation();
        OnSuccess(); // Reset failure count
        return result;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        OnFailure(ex); // Increment failure count
        throw;
    }
}
```

    public TValue Get(TKey key)
    {
        if (_cache.TryGetValue(key, out var node))
